									<h2>About the programme</h2>
									<p>What is Change Makers and what do we do?</p>
								</header>
								<hr />
								<p> Change Makers is an exciting new collaborative project between LSE and LSE Student Union that gives students the chance to undertake paid research into how we can enhance students' education and experiences across our school.</p>
								<p>All students are invited to take part, whatever your level of study. You are welcome to apply to the Change Makers programme as an individual or as a group. Students can apply for up to 60 hours of funding (at an hourly rate of £19.51) to undertake projects which meet our specific criterias. Successful team(s) will need to provide updates during your project to share with the LSE community, write up a case study about your project publication on LSE channels and present your findings at a School event in Summer Term.</p>
